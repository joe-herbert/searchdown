Add required option including valid function
Max input length option
Option to match regardless of accents
Option to limit the number of elements which can be selected
When using arrow keys to move down/up dropdown, scrollto currently selected (not smooth, just jump)
When up or down arrow keys are pressed, make sure the dropdown is open
When deleting an entered option, if dropdown is open then redo filter and showing so that just deleted option is added back to dropdown
Add color options for sdEntered
Hovering over a dropdown option should make that option the currently selected one, rather than having both a keyboard and mouse selection which can be confusing for the user
If hideEntered is false, show some indicator against those options which are already selected
Make sure clearing the input always works (search, use arrow keys to navigate but click on choice using mouse. hideEntered=true)
